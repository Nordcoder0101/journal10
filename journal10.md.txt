Day 10 Journal

So happy to have a bit of a reprieve over the weekend.  Was able to get the assignment done with Matt and it was pretty good.
I think I am seeing myself more on the back end of programming, I am not very good at the design element of things, art
has never been a strength for me.

I was able to get a whole bunch of work made up over the weekend also.  I still have a little bit to do, but happy to come
into this week pretty close to a clean slate.

I want to really pick up some steam and confidence the next 2 weeks.  If I don't see good improvement,  I will have to 
consider retaking this class.  Hopefully I won't have to.
